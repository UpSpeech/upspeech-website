# Cookie Policy

**Last Updated:** December 16, 2025

## Introduction

This Cookie Policy explains how UpSpeech uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our platforms. It explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control our use of them.

## What Are Cookies and Similar Technologies?

### Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, tablet) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently and provide information to website owners.

### Local Storage

Local Storage is a web storage mechanism that allows websites to store data directly in your browser. Unlike cookies, Local Storage data does not expire automatically and is not sent to the server with every request.

### Session Storage

Session Storage is similar to Local Storage but is cleared when you close your browser tab. It's used for temporary data that only needs to persist during a single browsing session.

## How UpSpeech Uses Cookies

UpSpeech uses different technologies on our **marketing website** and our **application platform**:

### Marketing Website (upspeech.app)

Our public-facing marketing website uses cookies and similar technologies to understand how visitors interact with our site and to improve your experience.

#### Analytics and Performance Cookies

**Google Analytics 4**

We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our website, which pages are most popular, and how users navigate our site.

| Cookie Name  | Purpose                                      | Duration | Type      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| **\_ga**     | Distinguishes unique users                   | 2 years  | Analytics |
| **\_ga\_\*** | Maintains session state for Google Analytics | 2 years  | Analytics |
| **\_gid**    | Distinguishes unique users                   | 24 hours | Analytics |
| **\_gat**    | Throttles request rate to Google Analytics   | 1 minute | Analytics |

**Microsoft Clarity**

We use Microsoft Clarity to understand how users interact with our website through session recordings and heatmaps.

| Cookie Name | Purpose                                     | Duration   | Type      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| **\_clck**  | Persists Clarity User ID across visits      | 1 year     | Analytics |
| **\_clsk**  | Connects multiple page views in one session | 1 day      | Analytics |
| **CLID**    | Identifies user across multiple domains     | 1 year     | Analytics |
| **SM**      | Synchronizes user ID across domains         | Session    | Analytics |
| **MR**      | Indicates if a data refresh is needed       | 7 days     | Analytics |
| **MUID**    | Microsoft User Identifier                   | 1 year     | Analytics |
| **ANONCHK** | Indicates whether MUID cookie is used       | 10 minutes | Analytics |

**Consent Management**

| Storage Item                | Purpose                            | Type      | Duration  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| **upspeech_cookie_consent** | Stores your cookie consent choices | Essential | Permanent |

This is stored in Local Storage (not a cookie) and remembers whether you've accepted or declined analytics cookies.

#### How We Use Analytics Data

We use analytics data to:

- Understand which pages are most visited and useful
- Identify technical issues and improve site performance
- Optimize user journeys and improve the overall experience
- Understand where our visitors come from (e.g., search engines, social media)

**We do NOT:**

- Sell or share your data with third parties for advertising
- Use analytics data to identify individual users
- Track you across other websites outside of UpSpeech

### Application Platform (app.upspeech.com)

Our application platform primarily uses Local Storage (not cookies) for essential functionality:

#### Essential Local Storage

| Data Item        | Purpose                                                     | Duration |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **auth_token**   | JWT authentication token for maintaining your login session | 24 hours |
| **user_data**    | Cached copy of your user profile for faster page loads      | Session  |
| **token_expiry** | Expiration timestamp of your authentication token           | 24 hours |

#### Functional Local Storage

| Data Item            | Purpose                                                      | Duration  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| **language**         | Your selected interface language (English, Portuguese, etc.) | Permanent |
| **theme_preference** | Your color theme preference (light/dark mode)                | Permanent |

#### Session Storage (Temporary)

We may use Session Storage for temporary data such as:

- Form data preservation (to prevent data loss if you navigate away)
- Temporary UI state (e.g., collapsed sidebars, active tabs)
- Short-lived feature flags for A/B testing

Session Storage data is automatically cleared when you close your browser tab.

#### Analytics (Optional - Coming Soon)

We may introduce similar analytics to the application platform in the future to improve the user experience. If we do, we will:

- Update this policy and notify you
- Provide clear opt-in/opt-out controls
- Use the same privacy-respecting approach as our marketing website

## Cookie Consent and Your Choices

### Marketing Website

When you first visit our marketing website, you'll see a consent banner that allows you to:

- **Accept All** - Allow all analytics cookies
- **Decline** - Block all non-essential cookies

You can change your consent preferences at any time by:

1. Clearing your browser's cookies and Local Storage
2. Revisiting the website (the consent banner will reappear)
3. Making a new selection

We use **Google Consent Mode v2**, which means:

- If you decline cookies, Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity will operate in a privacy-enhanced mode
- Your choice is respected and stored locally
- Analytics scripts will not track you if you've declined

### Application Platform

For the application platform:

- **Essential storage (authentication) cannot be disabled** - Without it, you cannot log in or use the platform
- **Functional storage (preferences) can be cleared** - But you'll need to re-select your preferences on each visit
