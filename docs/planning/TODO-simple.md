# User TODOs

## Unprioritized

- [ ] seeds for milestone videos aren't working. Have them like the minigame video seeds
- [ ] On quiz answers, after checking answer we need to better highlight our answer if wrong, and the correct answer
- [ ] On quiz completion, we should move the patient back to the learning path page, and the step should have a visual difference and a way for the patient to retake the quiz
- [ ] Identification step error (Review Therapist video)
- [ ] Therapist learning path, when clicking "Exercises" for a step:
  - [ ] Both modals open at the same time, weird interactions
  - [ ] Translation errors inside the exercise selection modal
- [ ] Identification milestone steps, try to rework to reuse and look more like RecordingAnnotationPage instead of a dropdown
- [ ] Identification milestone steps, need multiple "exercises". One to review the video, one to identify stuttering moments, one for then marking these as short vs long and soft vs tense and one to identify avoidance/struggle moments. This needs to be consolidated into one step. The step can be then set again with a new video (or set X times from the start with X number of videos). Last step is the same exercise with patient own video.
- [ ] Need padding on learning path steps horizontally.
- [ ] Holding exercises
  - [ ] The cadence is too quick. Need to wait like 30 seconds before first "get ready"
  - [ ] Check old version, we had a button to press and keep holding, to have a physical interaction together with the holding
  - [ ] Don't force holding time, just "Get ready", and then something like "now whenever you're ready, press and hold". Then after the user lets go, wait another 30 seconds. This way we can record it and keep the timestamps for start and end holding
- [ ] Voluntary stuttering
  - [ ] Need to be able to hold the button, not mark start/mark end. Same thing as above, we should store these timestamps. Having 2 buttons breaks the flow.
- [ ] Phone Call scenario
  - [ ] Choose a disclosure prompt to practice, selected level badge cannot be read.
- [ ] Scenario with technique identification
- [ ] Buttons need to be holdable, same as above. also distribute them more evenly horizontally
- [ ] Autonomous pauses
  - [ ] should not be a predetermined duration, user should mark this (ideally, again, through holding)
- [ ] Some steps are giving internal error:
  - [ ] Review therapist video (step 2.1)
  - [ ] Watch modeling videos (step 6.2)
  - [ ] Communication scenario -> on start scenario practice button click (step 6.7)
  - [ ] Final generalisation scenario -> on start scenario practice button click (step 8.2)
