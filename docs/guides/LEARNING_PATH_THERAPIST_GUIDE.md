# Learning Path - Therapist Guide

This guide covers how to manage your patients' therapy journeys using the Learning Path system.

## Overview

The Learning Path is a structured therapy program with 8 milestones, each containing multiple steps. It follows evidence-based stuttering therapy progression:

1. **Understanding** - Education about stuttering
2. **Identification** - Recognizing stuttering moments
3. **Modification** - Learning techniques
4. **Holding** - Prolongation practice
5. **Release** - Smooth transitions
6. **Generalization** - Real-world application
7. **Self-Disclosure** - Open communication
8. **Maintenance** - Long-term strategies

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to **"Learning Paths"** in the main menu to see all your patients' progress.

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard shows:
- **Total patients** with learning paths
- **Active patients** currently working on steps
- **Needs attention** - patients who may need check-in
- Patient list with progress indicators

### Filtering Patients

Use the filters to find specific patients:
- **Search** by name
- **Filter by status** (active, paused, completed)
- **Filter by milestone** to see who's working on what

## Creating a Learning Path

When you assign a new patient:

1. Go to **Patient Detail** page
2. Click **"Start Learning Path"**
3. The system creates a personalized journey starting at Milestone 1

The patient will see their journey immediately after creation.

## Managing Patient Progress

### Viewing Patient Detail

Click on a patient to see their detailed progress:
- Current milestone and step
- Completion percentage
- Practice statistics (attempts, time)
- Recent activity

### Step Management

For each step, you can:

**Complete a Step**
- Mark a step as complete when the patient has demonstrated mastery
- Patient can also self-complete when they feel ready

**Skip a Step**
- Skip steps that aren't applicable for this patient
- Use sparingly - skipping too many breaks the learning progression

**Reopen a Step**
- If a patient needs more practice, reopen a completed step
- The patient returns to practicing that step

### Adding Therapist Notes

Each step has a notes field visible only to you:
- Document observations during sessions
- Track what the patient struggles with
- Note successful strategies

Click the notes icon on any step to add or edit notes.

## Customizing Exercises

Each step comes with default exercises, but you can customize them for each patient:

### Enable/Disable Exercises

Not all exercises work for every patient:
1. Open the step detail
2. Toggle exercises on/off as needed
3. Disabled exercises won't appear for the patient

### Customize Instructions

Personalize the experience:
1. Click the edit icon on an exercise
2. Modify instructions for this specific patient
3. Changes only affect this patient's view

### Exercise Types

- **Standard** - Recording-based practice
- **Quiz** - Knowledge assessment
- **Modeling** - Self-evaluation with ratings
- **Holding** - Prolongation with waveform visualization
- **Scenario** - Conversational practice

## Questionnaires

When patients complete milestones, they're prompted to answer brief questionnaires:
- Questions assess confidence and progress
- Responses appear in the patient's record
- Use feedback to guide future sessions

## Pausing and Resuming

### Pausing a Learning Path

If a patient needs a break:
1. Open patient detail
2. Click **"Pause Journey"**
3. The path remains in place but patient sees "paused" status

### Resuming

Click **"Resume Journey"** when ready to continue.

## Best Practices

### Regular Check-ins

- Review patient progress weekly
- Look for patterns in practice frequency
- Address barriers to practice early

### Personalization

- Customize exercise instructions for each patient
- Disable exercises that aren't relevant
- Add notes about what works

### Celebrating Progress

- Acknowledge milestone completions in sessions
- Use the acknowledgment messages to reinforce progress
- Frame setbacks as normal parts of the journey

### When to Skip vs. Practice

Skip when:
- A concept is already mastered
- An exercise type doesn't suit the patient
- Medical/accessibility reasons

Practice when:
- Mastery isn't demonstrated
- The patient is avoiding challenging content
- Building foundational skills

## Troubleshooting

### Patient Not Seeing Journey

Check that:
- Learning path was created for the patient
- Patient is linked to your practice
- Journey isn't paused

### Progress Not Updating

- Progress syncs when patient completes actions
- Check last activity date
- Contact support if data seems stuck

### Exercise Customizations Not Saving

- Ensure you click "Save" after editing
- Refresh the page to verify changes
- Check for validation errors
