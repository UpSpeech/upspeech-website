# Learning Path - Patient Guide

Welcome to your speech therapy journey. This guide will help you navigate your personalized learning path.

## Getting Started

When you log in, you'll see **"My Journey"** in the navigation menu. This is your personal therapy journey, designed by your therapist specifically for you.

### What You'll See

Your journey is organized into **milestones** - major achievements on your path. Each milestone contains **steps** - smaller, focused practice sessions.

The journey flows upward, like climbing a mountain. You'll see:
- Your current step highlighted at the top
- Completed milestones below, celebrating your progress
- A preview of what's coming next

## Practicing

### Daily Practice

1. Click on your **current step** to see the exercises
2. Each exercise has instructions - read them carefully
3. Click **"Practice"** to begin an exercise
4. Take your time - there's no rush

### Types of Exercises

Your therapist may assign different types of practice:

- **Recording exercises**: Record your voice practicing specific techniques
- **Quiz exercises**: Test your understanding of speech concepts
- **Self-reflection**: Rate your own speech and write notes
- **Pause exercises**: Practice inserting natural pauses
- **Scenarios**: Practice speaking in realistic situations

### Tips for Success

- **Practice regularly** - Short, frequent sessions work better than long, occasional ones
- **Be patient with yourself** - Progress isn't always linear
- **Use the instructions** - Your therapist wrote them specifically for you

## Returning After Time Away

If you haven't practiced for a while, don't worry. When you return:

- You'll see a **welcome back message** from your therapist
- Your progress is saved exactly where you left it
- You can pick up right where you stopped

There are no streaks or penalties. Life happens, and your journey waits for you.

## Your Progress

You can see:
- **How many steps** you've completed
- **Total practice time** for each step
- **Number of attempts** for each exercise

Your therapist can also see this information to provide better guidance.
